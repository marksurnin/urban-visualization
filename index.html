          This is a data visualization project built for Mashups course taught by Craig Protzel at New York University Abu Dhabi.
          It uses Three.js 3D JavaScript animation library to visualize the level of urbanization of different countries relative to their population. The data is accessed from the World Bank. The inspiration for such medium of visualization came from driving along the Sheikh Zayed Road in Dubai, which is essentially a long straight road with skyscrapers on either side. The height of each block in the visualization represents the relative urbanization level of the respective country, identified by the tiled texture of the country's flag. The actual values are not shown, as the idea is to compare the relative urbanization level of countries, especially when two countries with vastly different urbanization levels are placed together.
